## Motion Design & Animation Guidelines

### Accessibility-First Motion Philosophy

Based on extensive research into motion design accessibility, KingdomQuest animations prioritize user comfort and inclusivity over visual flash. Our motion design serves the content and users, never overwhelming or distracting from the spiritual experience.

### Core Motion Principles

1. **Reduced Motion First**: Design baseline experience without motion
2. **User Control**: Respect system preferences for reduced motion
3. **Purposeful Movement**: Every animation serves a clear functional purpose  
4. **Gentle Transitions**: Smooth, calm animations that support content
5. **Age Appropriateness**: Motion that works for both children and seniors
6. **Cultural Reverence**: Animations that maintain spiritual dignity

### Technical Animation Standards

#### Duration Guidelines
- **Micro-interactions**: 150ms (button hover, form feedback)
- **Standard transitions**: 250ms (navigation, modal appearance)
- **Content transitions**: 350ms maximum (page transitions, card reveals)
- **Loading animations**: Gentle, non-distracting continuous loops
- **Reduced motion**: 0ms for users with motion sensitivity

#### Easing Functions
```css
/* Gentle, accessible easing curves */
--ease-gentle: cubic-bezier(0.25, 0.46, 0.45, 0.94);
--ease-in-gentle: cubic-bezier(0.55, 0.085, 0.68, 0.53);
--ease-out-gentle: cubic-bezier(0.25, 0.46, 0.45, 0.94);

/* Respect user preferences */
@media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce) {
  * {
    animation-duration: 0.01ms !important;
    animation-iteration-count: 1 !important;
    transition-duration: 0.01ms !important;
  }
}
```

### Animation Categories

#### 1. Navigation Transitions
**Purpose**: Guide users through app structure without confusion
**Implementation**:
- Gentle slide transitions between pages
- Fade-in for new content appearing
- Subtle scale animations for button presses
- Clear visual hierarchy maintained during transitions

```css
.page-enter {
  opacity: 0;
  transform: translateY(10px);
}
.page-enter-active {
  opacity: 1;
  transform: translateY(0);
  transition: opacity 250ms, transform 250ms;
}
```

#### 2. Content Revelation
**Purpose**: Progressive disclosure of information without overwhelming

/* Comprehensive reduced motion support */
@media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce) {
  .animate-gentle-fade-in,
  .animate-peaceful-float,
  .animate-divine-glow,
  .stagger-children > * {
    animation: none !important;
    opacity: 1 !important;
    transform: none !important;
  }
  
  * {
    animation-duration: 0.01ms !important;
    animation-iteration-count: 1 !important;
    transition-duration: 0.01ms !important;
    scroll-behavior: auto !important;
  }
}
```

### JavaScript Animation Framework

#### Core Animation Controller
```javascript
class KingdomQuestAnimations {
  constructor() {
    this.reducedMotion = window.matchMedia('(prefers-reduced-motion: reduce)').matches;
    this.initializeAnimations();
  }
  
  // Respect user motion preferences
  animate(element, animationType, options = {}) {
    if (this.reducedMotion) {
      return this.instantReveal(element);
    }
    
    return this.performAnimation(element, animationType, options);
  }
  
  // Gentle content revelation
  revealContent(elements, stagger = 100) {
    if (this.reducedMotion) {
      elements.forEach(el => el.style.opacity = '1');
      return;
    }
    
    elements.forEach((element, index) => {
      setTimeout(() => {
        element.classList.add('animate-gentle-slide-up');
      }, index * stagger);
    });
  }
  
  // Spiritual atmosphere effects
  createPeacefulAtmosphere(container) {
    if (this.reducedMotion) return;
    
    const floatingElements = container.querySelectorAll('.spiritual-element');
    floatingElements.forEach(el => {
      el.classList.add('animate-peaceful-float');
    });
  }
  
  // Achievement celebration
  celebrateAchievement(element, level = 'gentle') {
    if (this.reducedMotion) {
      element.classList.add('highlighted');
      return;
    }
    
    const celebrationClass = level === 'children' ? 
      'celebrate-joyful' : 'celebrate-reverent';
    element.classList.add(celebrationClass);
  }
}
```

### Performance Optimization

#### Animation Performance Guidelines
- **GPU Acceleration**: Use `transform` and `opacity` for smooth animations
- **Will-Change**: Apply `will-change` property judiciously for complex animations
- **Frame Rate**: Target 60fps, fallback to 30fps on lower-end devices
- **Battery Consideration**: Pause animations when page not visible
- **Memory Management**: Clean up animation listeners and references

#### Loading and Initialization
```javascript
// Initialize animations only after critical content loads
document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', () => {
  if ('requestIdleCallback' in window) {
    requestIdleCallback(() => {
      new KingdomQuestAnimations();
    });
  } else {
    setTimeout(() => {
      new KingdomQuestAnimations();
    }, 100);
  }
});
```
