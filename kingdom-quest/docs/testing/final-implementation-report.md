✓ validateTheologicalContent(content: string, context: ContentValidationContext): TheologyValidationResult
✓ validateDenominationalNeutrality(content: string): string[]
✓ validateContent(content: string, context: ContentValidationContext, scriptureRefs?: ScriptureReference[]): TheologyValidationResult
```

**SafetyModerator Class (`lib/safety-moderator.ts`)**
```typescript
// Validated Methods:
✓ validateContent(content: string, context: ContentContext): SafetyValidationResult
✓ validateImage(imageUrl: string, altText: string, context: ContentContext): SafetyValidationResult
