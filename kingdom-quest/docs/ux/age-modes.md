## Technical Implementation

### Age Mode Context Provider

```typescript
const AgeModeContext = createContext<AgeModeContextType>()

export function AgeModeProvider({ children }) {
  // Manages age tier state
  // Loads user-specific settings
  // Provides adaptive functionality
  // Handles analytics tracking
}
```

### Adaptive Difficulty Algorithm

```typescript
// Core algorithm in adaptive-quiz-difficulty edge function
const calculateDifficulty = (accuracy, attempts, ageTier) => {
  // Weight recent performance
  const rollingAccuracy = (prevAccuracy * 0.7) + (currentScore * 0.3)
  
  // Age-appropriate thresholds
  const thresholds = getAgeThresholds(ageTier)
  
  // Determine new difficulty level
  if (rollingAccuracy >= thresholds.advanced) return 'advanced'
  if (rollingAccuracy >= thresholds.intermediate) return 'intermediate'
  return 'beginner'
}
```

### CSS Architecture

```css
/* Age-specific styling */
.age-tier-toddler button {
  min-height: 4rem;
  min-width: 4rem;
  font-size: 1.25rem;
}

.reduce-motion * {
  animation-duration: 0.01ms !important;
  transition-duration: 0.01ms !important;
}
```

## Usage Examples

### Basic Age Mode Setup

```typescript
const { setupAgeMode } = useAgeMode()

// Initialize user's age mode
await setupAgeMode('elementary', 'John Doe')
```

### Adaptive Quiz Implementation

```typescript
<AdaptiveQuizMaster
  category="biblical-knowledge"
  onComplete={(results) => {
    console.log('Quiz completed:', results)
  }}
/>
```

### Family Account Management

```typescript
const { createChildProfile, manageParentalControls } = useFamilyManager()

// Add child account
await createChildProfile({
  name: 'Sarah Doe',
  ageTier: 'preschool',
  parentId: user.id
})
```
