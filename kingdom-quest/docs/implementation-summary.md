- Age-appropriate complexity progression
- Theological accuracy markers and safety ratings

**Quizzes (`tests/fixtures/quizzes.ts`):**
- Age-tiered quiz questions with difficulty scaling
- Scripture-based questions with theological explanations
- Progressive passing score requirements by age
- Multiple question types (multiple-choice, fill-in-blank, true/false)

**Users (`tests/fixtures/users.ts`):**
- Complete family account structures with parent/child relationships
- Age-tier specific user profiles (toddler through adult)
- Permission levels and safety settings by age
- Progress tracking and achievement systems

**Prayers (`tests/fixtures/prayers.ts`):**
- Content moderation examples (approved, pending, rejected)
- Age-appropriate prayer content with safety guidelines
- Family sharing scenarios and moderation triggers

## ⚙️ Configuration & Scripts

### Package.json Scripts Added:
```json
{
  "test:unit": "vitest --run tests/unit",
  "test:theology": "vitest --run --reporter=verbose tests/unit/theology",
  "test:safety": "vitest --run --reporter=verbose tests/unit/safety",
