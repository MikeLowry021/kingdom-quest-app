{"extracted_information": "This content provides comprehensive UI/UX design principles for child-friendly interfaces, covering cognitive considerations for different age groups, age-appropriate interaction design, the role of animations, and best practices for creating engaging, educational, and safe digital experiences for children. It also includes statistics on children's technology use, the importance of co-designing with children, and the impact of good UX in various industries.", "specifications": {}, "pricing": {}, "features": [{"principle": "Simplicity and Clarity", "description": "Interfaces should be straightforward, uncluttered, with minimal text and large, tappable areas for interaction to maintain focus and reduce frustration. Children's attention span averages 8-12 minutes per task.", "example": "Duolingo Kids app (clear, simple icons, bright colors)."}, {"principle": "Interactive and Engaging Elements", "description": "Incorporate touch, drag-and-drop, and animations.
