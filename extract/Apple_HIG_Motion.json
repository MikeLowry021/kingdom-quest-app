{"extracted_information": "Apple's Human Interface Guidelines for motion and animation emphasize purposeful, fluid, and consistent design. Motion should convey status, provide feedback and instruction, and enrich the visual experience without overshadowing it. Gratuitous or excessive animation can distract or cause physical discomfort.
