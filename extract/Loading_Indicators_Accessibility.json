{"extracted_information": "Loading indicators are visual cues that inform users about the status of a process or operation, such as loading data, processing a request, or uploading a file. They enhance user experience by providing feedback and managing expectations. Ensuring accessibility is crucial for all users, including those with disabilities, to perceive and understand the conveyed information. Inaccessible indicators can lead to poor user experience and exclusion. The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG 2.1) emphasize clear and consistent indication of the loading process.", "specifications": {"loading_indicator_types": [{"type": "Determinate", "description": "Displays a specific percentage or progress of the task."}, {"type": "Indeterminate", "description": "Displays a continuous animation without a specific percentage or progress."}], "wcag_2_1_guidelines": {"color_contrast": {"normal_text_minimum_ratio": "4.5:1", "large_text_minimum_ratio": "3:1"}, "animation_motion_sensitivity": "Avoid animations that flash or blink more than three times per second."}}, "pricing": {}, "features": [{"category": "Design Considerations for Accessibility", "items": ["Color Contrast and Visual Design: Use a color scheme with sufficient contrast (e.g., WCAG 2.1 minimums).
