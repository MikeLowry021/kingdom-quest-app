{"extracted_information": "In Christian tradition, emerald symbolizes resurrection, rebirth into a new and purer life, and when applied to Christ, his qualities of kindness and goodness. It is mentioned in biblical contexts such as the stones of Israel's twelve tribes, foundations of New Jerusalem, the high priestâ€™s breastplate, and the twelve Apostles. Andreas, Bishop of Caesarea (10th century), associated the emerald (green color) with John the Evangelist, signifying soothing souls and strengthening faith. Rabanus Maurus, Archbishop of Mainz (late 8th century), included emerald among the twelve apocalyptic gems, signifying 'strength of faith in adversity'. In rabbinical legend, an emerald was given by God to King Solomon, granting him power over creation. Emerald rings worn by Christian clergy during the Middle Ages signified the Resurrection and the virtue of hope.", "specifications": {}, "pricing": {}, "features": [{"symbol": "Resurrection", "context": "Christian tradition", "description": "Symbolizes rebirth into a new and purer life."}, {"symbol": "Christ's Qualities", "context": "Christian tradition", "description": "Represents kindness and goodness."}, {"symbol": "Faith Strength", "context": "Christian tradition (Rabanus Maurus)", "description": "Expresses 'strength of faith in adversity'."}, {"symbol": "Divine Soothing & Faith Strengthening", "context": "Christian tradition (Andreas, Bishop of Caesarea)", "description": "Signifies John the Evangelist, soothing souls dejected by sin with divine oil and lending constant strength to faith."}, {"symbol": "Hope", "context": "Christian clergy (Middle Ages)", "description": "Signified by emerald rings worn by clergy, alongside Resurrection."}], "statistics": {}, "temporal_info": {"10th Century": "Andreas, Bishop of Caesarea", "Late 8th Century": "Rabanus Maurus, Archbishop of Mainz", "Middle Ages": "Ecclesiastical rings worn by clergy"}, "geographical_data": {"Biblical Locations": "Israel (stones of twelve tribes), New Jerusalem (foundations)"}, "references": ["Kuntz (1913)", "Andreas, Bishop of Caesarea (10th century)", "Rabanus Maurus, Archbishop of Mainz (late 8th century)", "Bible"]}
