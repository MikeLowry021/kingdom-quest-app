{"extracted_information": "The web content outlines Microsoft's Inclusive Design methodology, principles, and provides a collection of tools and guidebooks. It defines Inclusive Design as a methodology born from digital environments that embraces human diversity, focusing on recognizing exclusion, learning from diversity, and solving for one to extend to many. While it offers extensive guidelines for inclusive design thinking and practice through various downloadable resources, it does not detail specific technical accessibility requirements or a formal design system's technical specifications for inclusive interfaces. The content emphasizes methodology and mindset over prescriptive technical standards.", "specifications": {"accessibility_requirements": "Specific technical accessibility requirements are not detailed in the provided content.
