# KingdomQuest Application Test Report

## Test Objective
Verify that React Error #310 is resolved in the KingdomQuest application and confirm the application loads properly.

## Test Execution Details
- **Test Date:** 2025-08-26 09:00:19
- **URL Tested:** https://5ug9r265hsyk.space.minimax.io
- **Test Type:** Application Load Verification & Console Error Check

## Test Results

### 1. Application Load Status
❌ **FAILED** - Application did not load properly

**Issue Found:** The URL displays a "404 Page Not Found" error page instead of the KingdomQuest application.

### 2. Browser Console Check
✅ **CLEAN** - No error logs found in browser console
- No React Error #310 detected
- No JavaScript errors present
- Console is completely clean

### 3. Visual State Analysis
The page displays:
- HTTP 404 status code
- "Page Not Found" message
- Description: "The page you're looking for doesn't exist or has been moved"
- "Go Back" navigation button

### 4. Screenshot Evidence
- Full page screenshot captured: `kingdomquest_404_error.png`
- Shows complete 404 error page state

## Key Findings

1. **React Error #310 Status:** Cannot verify resolution as the application is not loading
2. **Primary Issue:** Server-side 404 error preventing application access
3. **Console Status:** Clean - no JavaScript or React errors detected
4. **Application Availability:** Not accessible at the provided URL

## Recommendations

1. **Verify URL:** Confirm the correct URL for the KingdomQuest application
2. **Server Status:** Check if the application server is running properly
3. **Deployment Status:** Verify the application has been deployed to this endpoint
4. **Route Configuration:** Ensure proper routing is configured on the server

## Conclusion

While the browser console is clean with no React Error #310 present, the application cannot be tested for proper functionality due to a 404 error. The application appears to be unavailable at the specified URL, which prevents verification of the React error resolution.

**Status:** Test incomplete due to application unavailability
**Next Steps:** Address 404 error and re-test once application is accessible
