DEPLOYMENT FIX COMPLETED

New Working URL: https://e260zguwexp6.space.minimax.io

Actions Completed:
1. ✅ Confirmed next.config.js - Verified output is set to 'standalone'
2. ✅ Rebuilt application - Clean build from scratch to ensure proper standalone output
3. ✅ Fixed Directory Structure - Successfully copied both 'public' and '.next/static' directories into '.next/standalone'
4. ✅ Redeployed - Created new deployment with corrected structure

The 404 error has been resolved by:
- Performing a complete rebuild of the Next.js application
- Ensuring the standalone build includes all necessary static assets
- Properly copying the required directories for standalone deployment

The application should now be fully accessible and functional.
