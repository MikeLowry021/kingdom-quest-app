# KingdomQuest Theology Guardrails

## Core Theological Foundation

### Primary Authority: Scripture

**Foundational Principle**: "All Scripture is God-breathed and is useful for teaching, rebuking, correcting and training in righteousness" (2 Timothy 3:16, NIV)

KingdomQuest operates under the authority of Holy Scripture as the infallible Word of God. All content, teaching, and spiritual guidance must align with biblical truth as revealed in the canonical 66 books of the Bible.

**Scripture Translation Standards**:
- Primary: New International Version (NIV) for accessibility
- Secondary: English Standard Version (ESV) for study depth
- Additional: New Living Translation (NLT) for children's content
- Available: King James Version (KJV), New American Standard Bible (NASB)

### Central Gospel Truth

**Core Message**: "For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life" (John 3:16, NIV)

**Essential Gospel Elements**:
1. **God's Holiness**: "Holy, holy, holy is the Lord God Almighty" (Revelation 4:8)
2. **Human Sinfulness**: "For all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God" (Romans 3:23)
3. **Christ's Sacrifice**: "But God demonstrates his own love for us in this: While we were still sinners, Christ died for us" (Romans 5:8)
4. **Salvation by Faith**: "For it is by grace you have been saved, through faithâ€”and this is not from yourselves, it is the gift of God" (Ephesians 2:8)
5. **New Life in Christ**: "Therefore, if anyone is in Christ, the new creation has come: The old has gone, the new is here!" (2 Corinthians 5:17)

## Denominational Inclusivity Framework

### Unifying Principles

**Christological Orthodoxy**: All content must affirm Jesus Christ as:
- **Fully Divine**: "In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God" (John 1:1)
- **Fully Human**: "The Word became flesh and made his dwelling among us" (John 1:14)
- **Lord and Savior**: "If you declare with your mouth, 'Jesus is Lord,' and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved" (Romans 10:9)
- **Only Way to Salvation**: "Jesus answered, 'I am the way and the truth and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me'" (John 14:6)

### Denominational Accommodation

**Included Christian Traditions**:
- Protestant denominations (Lutheran, Methodist, Baptist, Presbyterian, etc.)
- Catholic traditions that affirm salvation by faith in Christ
- Orthodox traditions recognizing Christ as Messiah
- Pentecostal and Charismatic traditions
- Non-denominational Christian churches

**Exclusions**:
- Groups denying the deity of Christ
- Organizations rejecting salvation by faith alone
- Movements adding requirements beyond faith in Christ for salvation
- Cults or sects contradicting core Christian orthodoxy

**Handling Denominational Differences**:
- **Mode of Baptism**: Present multiple biblical examples without favoring one method
- **Church Governance**: Focus on biblical principles rather than specific structures
- **Spiritual Gifts**: Present biblical teaching while respecting diverse experiences
- **End Times**: Emphasize Christ's return while avoiding specific prophetic interpretations

*"Above all, you must understand that no prophecy of Scripture came about by the prophet's own interpretation of things. For prophecy never had its origin in the human will, but prophets, though human, spoke from God as they were carried along by the Holy Spirit." - 2 Peter 1:20-21*
