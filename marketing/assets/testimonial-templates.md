**Family:** Single mother household, one of three children
**Journey:** Started with free tier during a difficult family period
**Growth:** Went from reluctant Bible study participant to family faith leader

*"Michael was always my most resistant child when it came to family devotions. After his father passed away, he became even more withdrawn from faith conversations. We started with KingdomQuest's free stories about brave Bible heroes, and something clicked. Now he leads our family prayer time and shares Bible verses he learned from the app with his younger siblings. KingdomQuest gave him a way to process faith that felt safe and engaging."* - Jennifer M., Michael's mother
