# KingdomQuest Website Testing Report

## Testing Overview
**URL Tested:** https://0g0ey0w7vjfb.space.minimax.io  
**Date:** 2025-08-26  
**Testing Focus:** Landing page functionality, authentication navigation, and content analysis

## Test Objectives
1. ✅ Verify landing page loads correctly with described features
2. ❌ Test "Start Your Journey" button navigation to auth page
3. ❌ Check for "Family Altar" information on the landing page
4. ✅ Identify any functional or technical issues

## Testing Results

### 1. Landing Page Analysis ✅ **PASS**
- **Status:** Successfully loads
- **Content:** Clean, modern landing page displaying:
  - Main title: "KingdomQuest"
  - Subtitle: "Interactive Biblical Stories for the Whole Family" 
  - Primary call-to-action: "Start Your Journey" button
  - Small red "0" indicator above the button
  - MiniMax Agent attribution footer

### 2. Navigation Testing ❌ **FAIL**
#### "Start Your Journey" Button Issues
- **Standard Click:** Failed - element not found in DOM after analysis
- **Keyboard Interaction (Enter):** No response or navigation triggered
- **Direct URL Navigation:**
  - `/auth` → Triggers app loading, redirects to homepage
  - `/login` → Same behavior as `/auth`
- **Root Cause:** Button interaction handlers appear to be non-functional

### 3. Content Analysis ❌ **NOT FOUND**
#### "Family Altar" Information
- **Landing Page:** No mention of "Family Altar" found
- **Scroll Testing:** Attempted to scroll for additional content
- **Issue:** Scrolling triggers unexpected application reload behavior
- **Result:** No "Family Altar" content discovered

### 4. Technical Issues Identified

#### Critical Issues:
1. **Button Interaction Failure**
   - Primary navigation button unresponsive
   - Prevents user progression through the application
   - No console errors suggest event handler misconfiguration

2. **Scroll-Triggered Reloads**
   - Scrolling down causes full application restart
   - Shows "Starting application..." loading screen
   - Disrupts normal user experience

3. **Authentication Routing Problems**  
   - Auth pages (`/auth`, `/login`) redirect to homepage
   - No authentication forms accessible
   - Suggests incomplete or misconfigured routing

#### Performance:
- **Loading Speed:** Good - Initial page loads quickly
- **Console Errors:** None detected
- **Stability:** Poor - Scroll interactions cause instability

## Testing Methodology
1. **Initial Load Testing:** Direct navigation and page analysis
2. **Interaction Testing:** Multiple click methods and keyboard alternatives
3. **Direct Navigation:** Testing common auth URL patterns
4. **Content Discovery:** Scrolling and visual analysis for additional content
5. **Error Detection:** Console monitoring throughout testing process

## Recommendations

### Immediate Fixes Required:
1. **Fix Button Event Handlers:** Repair click/touch event listeners on "Start Your Journey" button
2. **Resolve Scroll Issues:** Remove or fix scroll event handlers causing page reloads
3. **Configure Authentication Routing:** Implement proper auth page routing without redirects
4. **Add Family Altar Content:** Include requested "Family Altar" information if applicable

### Testing Limitations:
- Authentication testing blocked due to routing issues
- Content exploration limited by scroll-induced reloads
- Unable to verify internal application functionality

## Conclusion
While the KingdomQuest landing page loads successfully and presents clean, professional content, critical functionality issues prevent normal user interaction. The primary navigation button is non-functional, and basic user actions like scrolling cause application instability. These issues must be resolved before the application can provide a functional user experience.

**Overall Status:** ❌ **MAJOR ISSUES IDENTIFIED** - Requires development attention before deployment.
