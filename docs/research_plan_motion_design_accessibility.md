# Motion Design Accessibility Research Plan

## Task Overview
Research motion design and microinteraction patterns suitable for accessible, family-friendly applications, focusing on cognitive differences, vestibular disorders, and varying technical literacy.

## Research Objectives
1. **Core Accessibility Guidelines**
   - [ ] Animation guidelines for cognitive differences
   - [ ] Guidelines for vestibular disorders
   - [ ] Technical literacy considerations
   
2. **Motion Preferences & Settings**
   - [ ] Reduced motion preferences (prefers-reduced-motion)
   - [ ] Appropriate animation speeds and timing
   - [ ] User control mechanisms
   
3. **Microinteraction Patterns**
   - [ ] Patterns that enhance content consumption
   - [ ] Patterns that minimize distraction
   - [ ] Age-appropriate interaction patterns
   
4. **Specific Application Areas**
   - [ ] Onboarding animations best practices
   - [ ] Loading states accessibility
   - [ ] Feedback patterns for all age groups
   
5. **Implementation Guidelines**
   - [ ] Technical implementation considerations
   - [ ] Testing methodologies
   - [ ] Design system integration

## Research Sources Strategy
- **Tier 1**: W3C accessibility guidelines, WCAG documentation
- **Tier 2**: Major tech companies' design systems (Google Material Design, Apple HIG, Microsoft Fluent)
- **Tier 3**: Academic research on vestibular disorders and animation
- **Tier 4**: UX research organizations and accessibility experts
- **Tier 5**: Case studies from family-friendly applications

## Expected Deliverables
