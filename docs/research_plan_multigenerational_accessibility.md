# Research Plan: Multigenerational Digital Accessibility Guide

## Task Type: Verification-Focused Task
**Focus**: Comprehensive research with deep verification of accessibility standards and age-specific requirements.

## Research Objectives
1. Document WCAG AA+ compliance requirements
2. Research cognitive accessibility considerations across age groups
3. Analyze motor accessibility requirements
4. Investigate visual accessibility standards
5. Identify age-appropriate UX patterns for each demographic
6. Specify technical requirements (color contrast, fonts, touch targets)
7. Document navigation and interaction patterns
8. Create age-specific guidelines for children, teens, adults, and seniors

## Research Plan

### Phase 1: Foundation Research
- [x] 1.1 Research WCAG 2.1 AA and AAA compliance standards
- [x] 1.2 Investigate W3C accessibility guidelines and updates
- [x] 1.3 Research government accessibility requirements (Section 508, ADA)
- [x] 1.4 Find official accessibility testing tools and methodologies

### Phase 2: Age-Specific Research
- [x] 2.1 Research accessibility requirements for children (ages 5-12)
- [x] 2.2 Research accessibility needs for teenagers (ages 13-17)  
- [x] 2.3 Research accessibility requirements for adults (ages 18-64)
- [x] 2.4 Research accessibility needs for seniors (ages 65+)

### Phase 3: Technical Requirements Research
- [x] 3.1 Research color contrast ratios and requirements
- [x] 3.2 Investigate font sizing standards and recommendations
- [x] 3.3 Research touch target size specifications
- [x] 3.4 Analyze keyboard navigation patterns
- [x] 3.5 Research screen reader compatibility requirements

### Phase 4: Cognitive and Motor Accessibility
- [x] 4.1 Research cognitive load considerations across age groups
- [x] 4.2 Investigate memory and attention span variations
- [x] 4.3 Research motor skill variations and adaptive technologies
- [x] 4.4 Analyze tremor and precision considerations for older adults

### Phase 5: Visual Accessibility Deep Dive
- [x] 5.1 Research vision changes across age groups
- [x] 5.2 Investigate color blindness accommodations
- [x] 5.3 Research low vision and blindness support
- [x] 5.4 Analyze high contrast and magnification requirements

### Phase 6: Navigation and Interaction Patterns
- [x] 6.1 Research age-appropriate navigation structures
- [x] 6.2 Investigate gesture patterns across age groups
- [x] 6.3 Research form design and input methods
- [x] 6.4 Analyze error handling and recovery patterns

### Phase 7: Industry Best Practices
- [x] 7.1 Research accessibility implementations from major tech companies
- [x] 7.2 Investigate accessibility testing methodologies
- [x] 7.3 Research assistive technology compatibility
- [x] 7.4 Analyze accessibility auditing processes

### Phase 8: Synthesis and Documentation
- [x] 8.1 Organize findings by age group and accessibility type
- [x] 8.2 Create comprehensive guidelines document
- [x] 8.3 Include practical implementation examples
- [x] 8.4 Document testing and validation approaches

## Success Criteria
- Comprehensive coverage of WCAG AA+ standards
- Age-specific guidelines for all demographic groups
- Technical specifications with exact measurements/values
- Practical implementation guidance
- Multiple verified sources for each major finding
- Actionable recommendations for designers and developers
