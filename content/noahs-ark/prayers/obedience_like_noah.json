  "content": "Dear Lord,\n\nWe read about Noah and how he obeyed You completely. When You told him to build the ark, he did exactly what You said, even when others didn't understand.\n\nHelp us to be obedient like Noah. When You speak to us through Your Word, help us to listen and follow Your commands with willing hearts.\n\nGive us courage to do what is right, even when it's difficult or when others might laugh at us. Help us to trust that Your ways are always best.\n\nMake us faithful servants who walk closely with You, just as Noah walked with You.\n\nThank You for Noah's example of faith and obedience.\n\nIn Christ's name, Amen.",
