  "content": "Faithful God,\n\nWe praise You for Your wonderful promises that never fail. When Noah and his family left the ark, You set a beautiful rainbow in the sky as a sign of Your covenant.\n\nYou promised never again to destroy the earth by flood, and You have kept that promise. Every time we see a rainbow, we remember Your faithfulness.\n\nThank You that all Your promises are true and sure. You keep Your word to us, just as You kept Your word to Noah.\n\nHelp us to remember Your promises when we are afraid or worried. Remind us of Your love, Your protection, and Your plan for our lives.\n\nLike the rainbow that appears after the storm, You bring hope and beauty into our lives after difficult times.\n\nWe trust in Your promises, Lord. You are faithful from generation to generation.\n\nIn Jesus' precious name, Amen.",
