  "historicalDetails": "Mount Ararat is traditionally considered the resting place of Noah's ark according to Genesis 8:4. The mountain consists of two peaks: Greater Ararat (5,137m) and Lesser Ararat (3,896m). Located in eastern Turkey near the Armenian and Iranian borders, this volcanic mountain has been a symbol of Armenian heritage and biblical history for millennia. Archaeological expeditions have searched this area extensively, though the ark itself has not been definitively found. The region was known in ancient times as Urartu, which corresponds to the biblical Ararat.",
